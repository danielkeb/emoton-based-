======================================Music Recommendation based on Facial Expression ðŸŽ¶ðŸ˜Š=======================================
Welcome to the Music Recommendation project! This project utilizes machine learning, TensorFlow, and MediaPipe to recommend music based on facial expressions. The goal is to create a unique and personalized music recommendation experience by analyzing the user's emotions through their facial expressions.

Project Overview
Features
Facial Expression Analysis: Utilizes MediaPipe to analyze facial expressions in real-time.
Machine Learning Model: TensorFlow is employed to build a machine learning model that correlates facial expressions with emotional states.
Music Recommendation: Based on the detected emotion, the system recommends music that aligns with the user's mood.
How it Works
Facial Expression Detection:

MediaPipe is used to detect facial landmarks and analyze facial expressions.
Key facial features are extracted for emotion analysis.
Machine Learning Model:

A TensorFlow model is trained on a dataset of facial expressions and corresponding emotional states.
The model predicts the user's emotion based on real-time facial data.
Music Recommendation:

A curated playlist is recommended based on the predicted emotional state.
Integration with music APIs allows for seamless playback and user interaction.
Setup and Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/danielkeb/emotion-based.git
cd emotion-based
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the following packages installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install mediapipe opencv-python tensorflow
Run the Application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run music.py
Usage
Open the application and grant necessary camera permissions.
The system will analyze your facial expression in real-time.
Based on your emotion, the application will recommend a playlist for you.
